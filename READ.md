# Assignment Overview
This lab assignment explores the practical applications of graph algorithms in solving real-world computational problems.
It forms a part of Lab Assignment 3: Graph Algorithms in Real-Life Applications, focusing on how algorithms like BFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and Prim’s MST can be applied in various domains.
The goal is to understand how these algorithms model real-life networks such as social media connections, transportation systems, emergency response routing, and telecommunication infrastructure — enabling efficient decision-making and optimization.

# Problems Implemented
